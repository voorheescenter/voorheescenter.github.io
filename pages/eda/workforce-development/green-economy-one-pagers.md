<!--- This document is a copy of the RMD output from "Front_End_Occupation_Table" that produces a MD markdown (due to keep_md and preserve_yaml). Changes required is to: 1) change file name to match permalink; 2) remove the "output" section of the YAML; and 3) make the table call to an iframe of the HTML widget before loading onto the website. 

The final steps to update the website, you need to transfer over 3 files:
1) Copy over this MD file into the "pages" subfolder matching the permalink in the YAML
2) Copy over the "occupations-one-pager" subfolder to the "download" subfolder
3) Copy over the "occupation-one-pager-front-end-table.html" to the "htmlwidgets" subfolder

The table below allows you to download one-pagers summarizing key information about Green Economy occupations in the Chicago Region. The Brookings Institute identified 320 unique occupations particularly concentrated in Green Economy industries. Additional information on Brookings' methodology is available [here](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019.04_metro_Clean-Energy-Jobs_Report_Muro-Tomer-Shivaran-Kane_updated.pdf). The Voorhees Center also produced a report evaluating the strength of these Green Economy industries in the Chicago Region that you can find [here](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/otysmqubv39nvpzdq17cdz5trpm5mqoh).

These one-pagers utilize the US Department of Labor's ONET Database, the nation's main source for occupational data, and the Bureau of Labor Statistic's (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS), which provides annual employment and wage estimates. Detailed economic data from OEWS are available for 264 of the 320 occupations in the Green Economy (83%), documenting information on Job Zones, technologies, certifications, employment, and the main tasks associated with the job.
